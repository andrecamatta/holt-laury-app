# Holt-Laury Test Simulator

An interactive web application that simulates the Holt-Laury test for measuring risk preferences. This educational tool helps users understand how their choices affect the estimation of their risk aversion parameter (ρ).

## Features

- Interactive choice-based test interface
- Real-time ρ (rho) calculation and interpretation
- Virtual balance system with gains/losses
- Detailed explanations of how choices affect risk assessment
- Modern, responsive dark theme design
- Smooth animations and transitions

## How It Works

1. Users start with a virtual balance of $1000
2. Through 10 rounds, users choose between:
   - Option A: A safer choice with moderate rewards
   - Option B: A riskier choice with potentially higher rewards
3. After each choice:
   - The outcome is simulated based on probabilities
   - The balance is updated
   - The risk aversion parameter (ρ) is recalculated
   - A detailed explanation is provided

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- No external dependencies
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Smooth animations for enhanced user experience

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Start making choices and learning about risk preferences!

## Educational Purpose

This simulator is designed for educational purposes to help students and researchers understand:
- How the Holt-Laury test works
- How risk preferences are measured
- The concept of risk aversion parameter (ρ)
- The relationship between choices and risk assessment
